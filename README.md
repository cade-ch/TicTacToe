
tictactoe.py lets you play a game of tic tac toe in the terminal.

to run tests, use the command `python -m doctest -v tests.txt`


tictactoe_bot.py lets you play against a minimax algorithm that, as far as I can tell, plays perfectly (which is pretty simple even for humans to do)

to test the ai script, run the same command but with `ai_tests.txt` instead
